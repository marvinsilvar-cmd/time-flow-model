\begin{abstract}
I present a novel cosmological framework, the \textit{Temporal Flow Theory} (TFT), in which the evolution of the Universe is described through a dimensionless temporal flow function $f(t)$ that governs (i) the density of bosonic spacing, (ii) the effective speed of light $c(t)$, and (iii) the generation of mass through temporal density. The theory reproduces key observational features such as the transparency epoch at recombination, the formation of hydrogen, cosmic homogeneity, and the value of the Hubble constant. TFT proposes that the early Universe began with zero bosonic separation, allowing only energy without mass, and that matter, mass, and space itself emerge as $f(t)$ increases. The model predicts a variable effective light speed $c(t)=c_0/f(t)$ and connects temporal density with mass acquisition through a Higgs-like mechanism. Comparisons with CMB (Planck) and Hubble expansion data are discussed along with testable predictions.

\section{Introduction}

The standard $\Lambda$CDM model describes the Universe using an expanding metric, dark matter, and dark energy. However, several problems remain unresolved, including the origin of inflation, the horizon problem, and the physical meaning of mass before the electroweak symmetry breaking.

In this work I propose the \textbf{Temporal Flow Theory} (TFT), based on the principle that the state of matter, mass, and even space itself are determined by the \textit{temporal density} between bosons. A dimensionless function $f(t)$ describes the temporal flow, normalized such that $f(t_0)=1$ today. When $f(t)$ was small in the early Universe, bosonic spacing was nearly zero, preventing mass from forming and allowing only highly compressed electromagnetic waves. As $f(t)$ increased, space appeared, mass emerged, and hydrogen became stable.

\section{Foundational Equations}

\subsection{Temporal Flow}
TFT assumes the Universe evolves according to a temporal flow function:
\begin{equation}
f(t_0)=1, \qquad 0 < f(t) \leq 1 .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Bosonic Separation and Temporal Density}
Temporal density is defined as:
\begin{equation}
D(t) = \frac{1}{f(t)} .
\end{equation}

At the beginning, $f(t)\rightarrow 0$ implies $D(t)\rightarrow\infty$, corresponding to zero bosonic separation.

\subsection{Variable Effective Speed of Light}

The effective speed of light is:
\begin{equation}
c(t)=\frac{c_0}{f(t)} .
\end{equation}

At recombination, $f \simeq 0.25$, the theory predicts:
\begin{equation}
c_{\text{CMB}} \approx 4c_0 = 1.2\times10^9\,\text{m/s}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Temporal Energy Relation}

A proposed generalization of Einstein’s relation:
\begin{equation}
E = m\,c(t)^3 .
\end{equation}

\section{Cosmic Evolution Under Temporal Flow}

\subsection{Phase I: Zero Bosonic Separation (No Space, No Mass)}
At $f(t)\to 0$, only energy exists. Mass cannot form due to infinite temporal density.

\subsection{Phase II: Electromagnetic Closed Waves}
With a slight increase in $f(t)$, closed electromagnetic waves appear but still without mass.

\subsection{Phase III: Mass Generation}
When $f(t)$ reaches a critical value, temporal density decreases enough for the Higgs-like mass mechanism to activate.

\subsection{Phase IV: Hydrogen Formation ($f(t)\approx 0.25$)}
Hydrogen becomes stable, leading to the first free photons — the CMB.

\section{Comparisons With Observations}

\subsection{Hubble Data}
TFT predicts a modified expansion relation driven by the temporal flow.

\subsection{CMB Temperature}
TFT reproduces recombination physics without invoking inflation.

\subsection{Bosonic Spacing and Higgs Field}
The increase of $f(t)$ increases bosonic spacing, enabling mass formation.

\section{Conclusions}

TFT provides a coherent and testable description of cosmic evolution, linking temporal flow to mass generation, bosonic spacing, effective light speed, and the emergence of space. Further research will involve numerical fits to Planck CMB data, refined Hubble comparisons, and potential laboratory-scale predictions for temporal density variations.
